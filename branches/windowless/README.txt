Description
-----------

AnkhUp is a Reincarnation cooldown monitor for shamans.

It can warn you when you're running low on ankhs, restock ankhs when you
interact with a vendor, and notify you when your Reincarnation cooldown
ends, and it remembers the date and time when you last Reincarnated.

The cooldown monitor can be shown in a small movable window, or on your
favorite DataBroker display addon.


Usage
-----

Options are available in the standard Interface Options window. You can
access the panel directly by typing "/ankhup" or by right-clicking the
standalone monitor window.


Localization
------------

AnkhUp is compatible with English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Русский,
한국어, 简体中文, and 正體中文 game clients.

AnkhUp is translated into English, Deutsch, Español, and Français. If
