Description
-----------

AnkhUp monitors your Reincarnation cooldown and helps manage your ankhs.

It can display a small monitor window, or plug into any DataBroker
compatible display addon. It also reminds you when you’re running low
on ankhs, and automatically buys more ankhs when you visit a vendor who
sells them.


Usage
-----

Options are available in the Interface Options window. You can also 
type “/ankhup”, or right-click the monitor window or DataBroker plugin,
to open the window directly to the AnkhUp panel.

Left-click and drag to move the monitor window.


Localization
------------

AnkhUp is compatible with English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Русский,
한국어, 简体中文, and 正體中文 clients.

AnkhUp is translated into English, Deutsch, Español, and Français. If
you can provide translations for another locale, please send me a PM
on either download site.

AnkhUp is compatible with WoW 3.2 (China) and WoW 4.0 (everywhere else).
