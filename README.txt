Description
-----------

AnkhUp is a Reincarnation cooldown monitor for shamans.

It shows you the cooldown status of your Reincarnation ability, notifies
you when Reincarnation becomes available again, and remembers the date
and time when you last Reincarnated.

The cooldown monitor can be shown in a small movable window, or on your
favorite DataBroker display addon.


Usage
-----

Options are available in the standard Interface Options window. You can
access the panel directly by typing "/ankhup" or by right-clicking the
standalone monitor window.

Credits & History
-------------------

The original Ankh Cooldown Timer addon, upon which this addon is based,
was written by Starforce of Shattered Hand (EU). I took over maintenance
and development in late 2006, and renamed the addon to AnkhUp in 2009.
