### Version 7.0.3.0

* Updated for WoW 7.0 (Legion)

### Version 6.1.0.56

* Updated for WoW 6.1

### Version 6.0.3.55

* **Renamed to Broker: Reincarnation.** The Reincarnation ability has not required ankhs or any other reagents in quite some time, and the addon's feature-set has diminished accordingly; this new name more accurately reflects its current purpose and functionality.
* Version numbers now indicate the number of releases, rather than SVN revisions.

### Version 6.0.2.140

* Updated for WoW 6.0
