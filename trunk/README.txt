## Description

AnkhUp is a Reincarnation cooldown monitor for shamans. It also warns
you for low ankhs, restocks ankhs at vendors, notifies you when the
cooldown on Reincarnation ends, and remembers the date and time when you
last Reincarnated. The cooldown monitor can be shown in a small movable
window, or on your favorite DataBroker display addon.

## Usage

Left-click and drag the standalone monitor window to move it.

Options are available in the Interface Options window. Right-click the
monitor or type "/ankhup" to open the Interface Options window directly
to the AnkhUp panel.
