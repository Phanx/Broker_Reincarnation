Description
-----------

AnkhUp is a Reincarnation cooldown monitor for shamans.

It shows you the cooldown status of your Reincarnation ability, notifies
you when Reincarnation becomes available again, and remembers the date
and time when you last Reincarnated.

The cooldown monitor can be shown in a small movable window, or on your
favorite DataBroker display addon.

Options are available in the standard Interface Options window. You can
access the panel directly by typing "/ankhup" or by right-clicking the
standalone monitor window.
